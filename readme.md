### Operating Systems
-	What are operating systems?
-	How operating systems run on hardware
-	Windows
-	Unix / Linux
-	Mac

### Types of software
-	Desktop
-	Web
-	Mobile
-	Hybrid
-	Embedded

### Types of languages
-	High level – high abstractions, lower detailed to hardware, focused building applications (JavaScript, Python, Go)
-	Low level – closer to hardware (Assembly, C, C++, Java, C#)
-	Compiled and Interpreted languages

### Error in Software Development Cycle
-	Syntax error
-	Logic error
-	Runtime error
-	Debugging skill

### Software Security
-	Libraries – application might depend from 3rd party libraries
-	CORS – cross origin resource sharing. When connecting backend with frontend with http protocol
-	XSS – cross site scripting. Application should validate user input before displaying it.
-	DDOS – distributed denial of service attack. Huge amount of requests to the system where server becomes overloaded.
-	SQL injection – it lets attackers manipulate database queries by injecting malicious input which often leads to data leaks, account takeover
-	CSRF – cross-site request forgery
-	Local threats
-	2 Factor Authentication – security process which requires user to provide two different type of verification. It protects against stolen or weak passwords and blocks phishing attack.

### OSI Model
- Application layer - HTTP
- Presentation layer - Encryption
- Session layer
- Transport Layer – TCP / UDP
- Network layer - IP
- Data Links
- Physical layer

### Protocols and Browsers
- http – hyper text transfer protocol
- https – hyper text transfer protocol secured
- ssl/tls – certificates
- AES enryption

### Docker - virtualization technology.
- Docker container orchestration is the automated management, coordination, and scheduling of multiple containers that run applications across clusters of machines.

In simple terms:
When you have many Docker containers (for example, web servers, databases, APIs) running across several servers, orchestration tools help you manage them — making sure they start, stop, scale, and communicate properly.

Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker Application using simple YAML configuration file.

### Database Design
DDL -  Creating Structure [	CREATE, ALTER, DROP ]
DML - Querying data [SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE INSERT ]

### Database Relationship types
1:1 one-to-one
1:m one-to-many
m:m many-to-many
