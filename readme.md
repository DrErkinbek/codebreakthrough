### Operating Systems
-	What are operating systems?
-	How operating systems run on hardware
-	Windows
-	Unix / Linux
-	Mac

### Types of software
-	Desktop
-	Web
-	Mobile
-	Hybrid
-	Embedded

### Types of languages
-	High level – high abstractions, lower detailed to hardware, focused building applications (JavaScript, Python, Go)
-	Low level – closer to hardware (Assembly, C, C++, Java, C#)
-	Compiled and Interpreted languages

### Error in Software Development Cycle
-	Syntax error
-	Logic error
-	Runtime error
-	Debugging skill

### Software Security
-	Libraries – application might depend from 3rd party libraries
-	CORS – cross origin resource sharing. When connecting backend with frontend with http protocol
-	XSS – cross site scripting. Application should validate user input before displaying it.
-	DDOS – distributed denial of service attack. Huge amount of requests to the system where server becomes overloaded.
-	SQL injection – it lets attackers manipulate database queries by injecting malicious input which often leads to data leaks, account takeover
-	CSRF – cross-site request forgery
-	Local threats
-	2 Factor Authentication – security process which requires user to provide two different type of verification. It protects against stolen or weak passwords and blocks phishing attack.

### OSI Model

- Session layer
- Transport Layer – TCP / UDP
- Network layer - IP
- Data Links
- Physical layer

### Protocols and Browsers
- http – hyper text transfer protocol
- https – hyper text transfer protocol secured
